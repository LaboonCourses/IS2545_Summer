### Web Testing Exercise

For this exercise, your goal is to generate Selenium tests which test the following six scenarios.  You may work with a partner or alone.

```
// Given that I am not logged on to Reddit
// When I go to the front page
// Then I should see that a search textbox appears
```

```
// Given that I am not logged in to Reddit
// When I go to the "new" page
// Then I should see that there are username and password textboxes
```

```
// Given some string for which I would like to search
// And which has been used in a previous submission
// When I search for that string
// Then I should see at least one instance of that string in the search results
```

```
// Given that I have logged in to Reddit
// When I visit any page
// Then I should see my username
// And a link to log off
```

```
// Given that I have logged in to Reddit
// When I click on a comment thread
// Then there should be a textbox where I can type in my witty comments
```

```
// Given that I have logged in to Reddit
// When I click my username
// Then I should see my link karma
// And my comment karma
```

You may use RedditTest.java (in the sample_code subdirectory) as a sample.

After you have completed this exercise, you may leave or work on your Deliverable 3.  You may not work on Deliverable 3 with a partner.
